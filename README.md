Climate change is exacerbating wildfire likelihood and severity in the western USA prompting an urgent need to understand, estimate, and forecast wildfire risk. Assessing wildfire risk  presents several challenges due to uncertainty in fuel flammability and ignition potential. Due to complex physiological mechanisms, estimating fuel flammability and ignitional potential has not been possible on landscape scales. Current wildfire risk estimation methods are simply insufficient to accurately estimate wildfire risk because of the lack of direct flammability-associated inputs. 

**FireNet is a rapid risk forecasting tool to characterize the three fundamental components of risk - hazard, exposure, and vulnerability - by combining high resolution remote sensing with deep learning.** The system integrates microwave remote sensing (Sentinel-1) and optical remote sensing (Landsat-8) information over 3 months to product accurate estimates of fuel conditions (cross-validated r-squared = 0.63) exceeding previous methods by a wide margin (r-squared = 0.3). Moreover, by linking the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) outputs for fuel conditions with data on human settlements and population density, FireNet indicates the aggregate risk imposed by wildfires on humans.
